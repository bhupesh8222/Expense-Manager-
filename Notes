- Styled Components 
    > They encapsulate CSS down to the component level and allow you to use JavaScript to define reusable styles.
    > Using styled-components, you can maintain the component-driven architecture that React already reinforces
    > It's also very powerful because it makes it easier to work with props and state.

const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 0.8rem 1.6rem;
  background-color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "purple" : "white")};
  border: 1px solid #00000;
  color: ${(props) => (props.primary ? "white" : "purple")};

    > With styled components, you don't need to manually pass the props to the CSS. It is automatically available,    
    > No class name bugs: styled-components generates unique class names for your styles. You never have to worry about duplication, overlap or misspellings.
